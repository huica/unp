About
-----

Units and Persons (UnP) is a small example application showcasing the
[Hierarchical User Interface Component Architecture (HUICA)](https://huica.org/) with the help
of technology stack based on [GemstoneJS](https://gemstonejs.com/) and [GraphQL-IO](https://graphql-io.com/). UnP is large
enough to be able to show various aspects of HUICA and small enough to
be still easy to comprehend.
